# Portable Usage Guide

## Ã°Å¸Å½â€™ Using PDF Organizer from Any Location

The PDF Organizer is now fully portable! You can run it from:

- ✅ USB flash drive
- ✅ External hard drive
- ✅ Network drive
- ✅ Any folder on your PC
- ✅ Cloud sync folders (Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.)

The tool **automatically detects** the current user's Downloads folder, so it works regardless of:

- Which computer you're on
- Which user account is logged in
- Where the tool is installed

---

## Ã°Å¸Å¡â‚¬ Quick Start (Portable Mode)

### Step 1: Copy All Files

Copy these files to your USB stick or any folder:

- All `.py` files
- All `.bat` files
- `requirements.txt`
- All `.md` documentation files

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (One Time Per Computer)

On each computer where you'll use the tool:

**Double-click:** `INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES.bat`

This installs Python packages to the user account (not the USB stick).

> **Note:** Dependencies need to be installed once per computer, not per USB stick.

### Step 3: Run from Anywhere

**Double-click:** `PORTABLE_LAUNCHER.bat`

The tool will:

- ✓ Auto-detect the current user's Downloads folder
- ✓ Work from whatever location it's in
- ✓ Remember your ebooks folder path
- ✓ Remember your API key

---

## 📋 What Gets Auto-Detected

### ✅ Automatically Detected

- **Downloads Folder:** `C:\Users\[CurrentUser]\Downloads`
  - Works for any user on any computer
  - No configuration needed

### 🔧 You Configure Once

- **Ebooks Folder:** e.g., `F:\ebooks` or `D:\MyLibrary`
  - Set once in the GUI
  - Saved in settings file
- **API Key:** Your Gemini API key
  - Enter once in the GUI
  - Saved in settings file

---

## 💾 Where Settings Are Saved

Settings are saved in the **user's home folder**, not on the USB stick:

**Windows:**

```
C:\Users\[YourName]\.pdf_organizer_settings.json
```

**Mac/Linux:**

```
/Users/[YourName]/.pdf_organizer_settings.json
OR
/home/[YourName]/.pdf_organizer_settings.json
```

This means:

- ✅ Settings persist across sessions
- ✅ Different computers can have different settings
- ✅ Multiple users on same computer have separate settings
- ✅ USB stick doesn't store personal data

2. Auto-detects: `C:\Users\HomeUser\Downloads`

1. Same USB stick: `PORTABLE_LAUNCHER.bat`
2. Auto-detects: `C:\Users\WorkUser\Downloads`

## Ã°Å¸Å½â€œ How Auto-Detection Works

```python
# The tool uses Python's pathlib to detect user home
from pathlib import Path
downloads = Path.home() / "Downloads"

# Example outputs:
# Windows: C:\Users\Peter\Downloads
# Mac: /Users/Peter/Downloads  
# Linux: /home/peter/Downloads
```

This ensures it works for **any user** on **any computer**! Ã°Å¸Å½â€°
